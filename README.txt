README file for Ansim Computer Game

Last Updated 03/11/22

Game Concept: Anaesthesia Simulation game based in a hospital where the player controls an anaesthetist who must meet with patients, anaesthetise them and respond to emergencies. 

Target Audience: 18+ medical and non-medical

Genre: Simulation in style a top down RPG

Game Flow Summary: The player is an anaesthetist and is expected to provide anaesthesia for various operations. The player will first meet the patient in dialogue pre-operatively, then meet with the theatre team to discuss the plan, then anaesthetise the patient in theatre with the option to speak to the patient in recovery afterwards. The player moves around the hospital and can enter into several types of clinical encounters (pre-op clinic, WHO checklist, theatre, post-op recovery). In these encounters the player will select options for dialog or choices in management of the patient. 

Look and Feel: top down RPG in hospital, it’s a professional occupational SIM. Sarcastic humour is prevalent but no light hearted humour.
